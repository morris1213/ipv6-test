# Project Blueprint

## Overview

A web application to test a user's IPv6 connectivity.

## Implemented Features

*   Initial project setup with Astro.
*   A single-page application that tests for basic IPv6 connectivity.
*   A test to check for IPv6 DNS resolution.
*   A dynamic particle effect background.

## Current Plan

*   Add a collision effect to the background particles to make them bounce off each other.

## Steps

1.  Update `src/layouts/Layout.astro` to enable the collision feature in the `tsparticles` configuration.
